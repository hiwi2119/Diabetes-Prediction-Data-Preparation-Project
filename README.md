# Diabetes-Prediction-Data-Preparation-Project
Diabetes Data Preparation Project

 Overview

This project focuses on cleaning, analyzing, and preparing a diabetes dataset for predictive modeling. The goal is to improve data quality by handling missing values, detecting outliers, and standardizing features to support accurate machine learning predictions.

Objectives

Handle missing and inconsistent data

Perform outlier detection and correction

Normalize and standardize numerical features

Generate new derived features (e.g., BMI category)

Prepare the dataset for predictive analytics and modeling


Tools & Technologies

Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

GitHub for version control

 Key Steps

1. Data loading and inspection

2. Missing value imputation (median/mean)

3. Outlier detection and removal

4. Data normalization and encoding

5. Final dataset export for model training

Results
Cleaned dataset with no missing values

Improved data consistency and structure

Ready-to-use data for ML model development
